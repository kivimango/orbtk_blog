# Application development with the Orbital Toolkit

## Prologue

Hello, my fellow developer.
This blog series is written to share my knowledge and experience to aid some help who wants to try out the [orbtk](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk) library until proper, detailed docs are available.  
There is already a [book](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk-book) in being written, you may want to check out that too.

## What is the Orbital Toolkit ?
The Orbital Toolkit, or just orbtk is a GUI library to enable developers to create graphical user interfaces using the programming language Rust.  
It was originally started around 2016 as a side project of the [Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org/) developers to make GUI [applications](https://github.com/redox-os/orbutils) for the Redox userspace.
After the 0.2, the toolkit is rewritten in 2019, and still developed since.

## Prerequisites
I assume that the following softwares are installed on your system:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) programming language
* An IDE or text editor (I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) with extensions/plugins)
* Basic knowledge of the Rust programming language
